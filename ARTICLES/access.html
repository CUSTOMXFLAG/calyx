                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="height: 102px;text-align: center;">The Bicycle Craze&nbsp;<br>1890</h1>
                <p class="text-center d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center">The bicycle has a rich history that spans over two centuries. In its early stages, the bicycle was a luxury item reserved for the affluent, with the penny-farthing being a notable example. This primitive design was used for racing, but it wasn't until the invention of the safety bicycle in the late 19th century that cycling became accessible to the masses.<br><br>The 1890s saw a phenomenon known as the "bicycle craze," where cycling became a national obsession in many countries. During this period, cycling clubs and teams sprouted up, women took to the roads, and bicycles made headlines in the news every day. Bike associations were formed, and the sport gained immense popularity. Although the craze was short-lived, lasting only about a decade, its impact on culture was lasting.<br><br>The bicycle's influence on transportation cannot be overstated. In fact, it predates the automobile and has remained a staple of urban mobility to this day. Interestingly, vintage bicycles from the 19th century still bear remarkable similarities to modern designs, a testament to the timelessness of the bicycle's appeal.<br><br>Today, cycling encompasses a diverse range of styles and disciplines. Racing, in particular, has evolved from its early roots, with modern cyclists pushing the limits of speed and aerodynamics. Our approach to cycling is functional-alternative, focusing on the aerodynamic properties of bicycles while embracing a more relaxed, street-style aesthetic. We prioritize freedom and self-expression, often wearing casual clothing, pyjamas, or costumes instead of traditional cycling gear.<br><br>At the same time, we recognize the value of different cycling styles, including trick bikes, which can be a fun and creative outlet in urban environments. Ultimately, our goal is to promote a culture of inclusivity, where cyclists of all speeds and styles can coexist and share the road. By embracing our diverse approaches to cycling, we can foster a sense of community and promote a more sustainable, enjoyable mode of transportation.</p>

                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Cycling can be portrayed often portrayed as an exclusive activity, a specialized activity, or an activity that requires knowhow requiring specialized gear and attire, requiring for you to wear a helmet, requiring you to ride on the road, requiring you to, folow a registration process, requiring licenses even in some cases. However, these perceptions can be misleading and intimidating, deterring people from embracing cycling as a mode of transportation or recreation.</span><br></p>

                <p class="text-center"><em>Cycling communities and historical stigmas can shed a particular light on cycling, constraining the concept to specific demographics, looks, or styles. This can create unnecessary stress and even endanger lesser experienced riders. Research has shown that social dynamics play a significant role in shaping our attitudes towards cycling. For example, a study published in the Journal of Transportation Geography found that cyclists are often stereotyped as being either "Lycra-clad enthusiasts" or "messengers," limiting the appeal of cycling to a broader audience (Steinbach et al., 2011).</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">The Impact of Associations</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>Moreover, the associations we make with cycling can also hinder people's enjoyment. For instance, the notion that cycling is only for poor people or children is a social construct that can deter others from taking up the activity. A study published in the Journal of Leisure Research found that people's perceptions of cycling are often influenced by their social environment and cultural background (Akar &amp; Clifton, 2009). Another study published in the Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour found that cyclists who are perceived as being part of a cycling "subculture" may face social stigma and negative stereotypes (Horton, 2007).</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">Vehicular Dominance and its Consequences</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>The dominance of vehicular culture has had a profound impact on our environment and society. The prioritization of cars over other modes of transportation has contributed to air pollution, urban sprawl, and social isolation. According to the World Health Organization (2018), air pollution from transportation is responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year. A study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that people who live in car-dominated cities are more likely to experience social isolation and decreased well-being (Kaplan, 1995).</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">Rethinking Our Priorities</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>If we were to redesign our transportation systems around the bicycle, we might be surprised at how efficient and beneficial it could be. In contrast to the negative consequences of car-dominated culture, a bike-centric approach would prioritize human health, environmental sustainability, and community engagement. With the benefits of regular cycling including reduced risk of chronic diseases, improved mental health, and increased productivity, it's surprising that more cities haven't adopted bike-friendly infrastructure. As we continue to grapple with the consequences of car-centric design, it's worth considering the humble bicycle as a model for sustainable transportation.</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">The Efficiency of Cycling</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>The bicycle is an incredibly efficient mode of transportation, requiring minimal infrastructure and energy compared to cars. In fact, studies have shown that investing in cycling infrastructure can have a significant return on investment, with some estimates suggesting that every dollar invested in cycling infrastructure can yield up to $3 in economic benefits (Gatersleben &amp; Appleton, 2007). As we look to the future, it's clear that a shift towards more sustainable transportation options is necessary. While electric cars may be a step in the right direction, the bicycle remains an underutilized tool in the fight against climate change and urban congestion.</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">Reclaiming Cycling</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>By reclaiming cycling as a mode of transportation and recreation, we can challenge the status quo and create a more just and sustainable society. We can reduce our carbon footprint, improve our physical and mental health, and build stronger, more connected communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020), regular cycling can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes.</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">The Power of Independent Thinking</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>We promote openness and freedom in culture for recreational cyclists. We think everyone who rides should be a pioneer of their own riding experience. By embracing our individuality and rejecting unnecessary rules, we can create a more enjoyable and liberating experience for ourselves and others.</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">Safety and Enjoyment</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>While safety is crucial, it's equally important to prioritize enjoyment and accessibility. Helmets are a personal choice, and we recommend that younger and newer riders use them. However, the biggest piece of safety gear you can have is under the helmet – your brain. Don't let fear or intimidation hold you back from experiencing the joy of cycling.</em><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xl-flex d-xxl-flex justify-content-xl-center justify-content-xxl-center">Creating a More Inclusive Culture</h1>
                <p class="text-center"><em>By promoting a more inclusive, casual, and accessible cycling culture, we can:</em><br><br><em>- Encourage participation: Make cycling more appealing to a broader range of people, regardless of age, ability, or background.</em><br><em>- Foster a sense of community: Celebrate the diversity of cycling experiences and styles, rather than trying to conform to a specific mold.</em><br><em>- Challenge societal norms: Recognize that the way we design our transportation systems reflects our values and priorities, and work towards creating a more just and sustainable society.</em><br></p>

                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">10 minimalist tips here: 1. Know your local Laws</span></strong><br></h1>
                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Check your municipal cycling laws. In some places it can be risky to ride on the sidewalk because you can get ticketed. Be aware of these laws but as urban riding can be rather oppourtunist, dont always let these laws get in your way… if&nbsp; it means that you will be much safer to ride on the sidewalk and theres nobody on it, use your judgement. Sometimes it might be worth getting a sour look from pedestrian passers by if it means you wont have to ride on a very busy road with a high speed limit or&nbsp; under a dangerous looking tunnel. Suburbs generally allow cycling on sidewalks because it is dangerous to ride on the busy roads and the sidewalks are rather unoccupied. In urban areas such as toronto , traffic is slower and there are less lanes so its much safer to share the road with vehicles, and nowadays we are even blessed with great bike lanes.</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">2.Anticipate Hazards</span></strong></h1>
                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pay attention to your surroundings, including road conditions, traffic, and weather. If youre sharing the road with vehicles and its night time, depending on your municipalities road conditions, things like potholes can be a significant hazard.</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">3.Make informed Decisions</span></strong></h1>
                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Adjust your speed, route, or actions based on your own judgment and experience. Dont fall into following other peoples methods, plans or pathways as they may not be the safest or most efficient for YOU. Following other cyclists on the road can lead you into an accident.</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">4.USE your ears</span></strong></h1>
                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When riding near to the road , a lesser appreciated advantage that cyclists have over drivers is the ability to hear the surrounding environment since a bicycle doesnt have an enclosure to block sound. As such, we don’t recommend having both ears plugged with earphones, ever, and if you will use a headphone we recommend having it at a low volume. </span><br><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">Since you can hear oncoming vehicles from very far away, your ears might make you even safer than traffic signals. We recommend that cycling is extremely safe due to the advantage of being able to hear. When theres alot of noise such as in some downtown urban areas undergoing construction or during loud festivals, you will want to ride with extra caution. Your 2 ears might be as important as your 2 wheels in making a “smooth” ride...</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">5. Know how-to and when-you-might FALL</span></strong></h1>
                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Most cycling injuries are minor and if you have a properly fitted bicycle, the dimensions actually make it so its rather difficult to fall or crash.&nbsp; For emergency situations however, it can be useful to incorporate your legs into cycling without the pedals so that you dont feel like your feet are glued to the pedals. Sometimes a little kick skid or push to the ground can prevent a pretty bad scrape form happening.&nbsp; Practicing braking with your foot by skidding sometimes or even practicing silly things like resting one leg on your fork can get you into the thinking that your limbs are not constrained to the bicycle.&nbsp; Sometimes trying to jump off a bike quickly before impact can potentially redirect the energy of the crash into the jump, significantly reducing the force of the impact. Remember in most cases you might not be going much faster than running, and if you fall , your injuries dont have to be significant. You can make an entire skill out of getting out of falling but just being aware that there are safe ways to fall&nbsp; can be enough to enable you to make the right kind of quick movement. Dont let yourself fall harder than you have to, if your going to!</span><br><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">Snow, hills, ice and sand all have different dynamics and you must be aware of this. If youre in a temperate climate with a cold winter like Toronto, practicing riding in a safe place on ice and snow can teach you alot about how to fall off your bicycle and incorporate your legs in other ways than pedalling(and it can be quite fun!)</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">6. Adjust your speed at turns</span></strong><br></h1>
                <p class="text-center">When riding at high speeds, especially down hills or immediately after, turning can be hazardous due to the combined effects of centrifugal force, momentum, and weight distribution. These physical forces can cause the bike to skid or destabilize, increasing the risk of a fall. on your side<span style="background-color: transparent;">. Some risk depends on weight and balance so you have to adjust your speed until your balance feels appropriate for the turn you are making. You want to be cautious making turns at high speeds and on angles.</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;"> While newer riders may not be aware, we have an inherent sense for speed and distance, learning your own way to fall and understanding how falls happen is another important aspect for newer riders for them to become comfortable when riding.</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">7. Ride slow</span></strong></h1>
                <p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">W</span>here are you going!? how much faster will you get there!? Have patience. Its something drivers also need to consider in principle. Its just not worth it to be unsafe and annoying to others when your'e probably not going to get there much faster anyway. Some people seem to want to risk their life to get to a place 5 minutes faster...<br><br>If you are going down a hill, pull your brakes a bit if you aren't confident in your ability to control your horse.</p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center" style="width: 901px;color: rgb(255,255,255);"><strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">8. Keep your chain and gears dry</span></strong></h1>
                <p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In general, if you encounter rain or especially snow, youo have to make sure you keep your chain and gears dry once you get your bicycle to shelter. Having a rusted chain gears can really slow you down and stop you from riding and it can be hugely annoying to deal with. Ideally you want to keep everything dry, but this is the most important piece.</span><br></p>

                <p class="text-center"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Select a bike that fits your needs, with decent build quality and materials that pertain to how and where you expect to ride.. While any bike is a "bike" ,department store bikes are not recommended- even the cheapest bike of a "real" brand from a bicycle shop will&nbsp; require less maintenance , ride smoother, and be less likely to fail. Make sure your bicycle correctly fits your height!! You may also want to consider your comfort and having a spring seat can significantly increase your comfort and speed- a finding supported by scientific research- While mountain bikes&nbsp; fat tire or BMX bikes may look cool, you may want to consider hybrid bikes if you are riding in urban areas as they can significantly increase your level of enjoyment relative to other types of bikes, if you arent focused on tricking and riding over very rough terrain.</span><br><br></p>

                <p class="text-center">Prioritize aerodynamicism and eliminaiting weight whenever possible. you dont need a bunch of bells and whistles if youre not going to enjoy it. if your rack is heavy or causes wind resistance, you will notice it while riding. If you pack a laptop, you will notice it. Of course youll want to carry things on your bike but ideally you want to pack as light as possible and pack only what you are going to use.</p>

                <p>Helmets are fairly cheap.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent;">We recommend that for younger and newer riders, we may want to accommodate them with as much safety equipment as possible, however, the biggest piece of safety gear you can have is under the helmet. The most serious injuries come from improper handling, terrain focus and vehicle avoidance.</span><br><br><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">Although many official organizations might recommend against not wearing a helmet and in some places, it is mandatory and enforced to wear a helmet(and you should definitely wear one in these situations) it might actually severely impact your enjoyment and we suggest that enjoyment and accessibility is a priority. It can get really sweaty riding with a helmet and its not insignificant. Plus we dont want to always be thinking -” I have to find my helmet and pads or my cycling shirt”, and thinking we have to do laborious things to prepare prior to cycling can create additional cognitive work. Just get out there! Dont pay attention to other peoples ways of cycling, make your own way of cycling, You already know what safety is!&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">Thats all you really need to know. So dont feel like you need to do alot to just get out there and bike. Most things you already know , very little preparation needs to be made and you dont have to look like others when you cycle. Following others can even lead you into accidents… Have Fun!</span><br></p>
                <h1 class="d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center">Embracing Accessibility and Inclusivity</h1>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent;">By promoting a more inclusive casual and accessible cycling culture, we can:</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">- Encourage participation: Make cycling more appealing to a broader range of people, regardless of age, ability, or background.</span><br><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">- Foster a sense of community: Celebrate the diversity of cycling experiences and styles, rather than trying to conform to a specific mold.</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ultimately, cycling is about freedom, enjoyment, and exploration. By embracing this spirit and rejecting unnecessary barriers, we can make cycling more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.</span><br></p>
