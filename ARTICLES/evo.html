It had 3 wheels and was particularly dangerous moving with a steaming pot on the front end.&nbsp; It was designed to transport cannons for the French Army and</span></strong>&nbsp;paved the way for the concept of self propelled vehicles. There were many different steam and gasoline powered vehicles that came afterward.

                    <p>Steam cars were successful , but they had serious limitations including weight complexity, and safety. In the 1860s, Nicolaus Otto invented the first&nbsp; internal combustion engine fuelled by oil. The corresponding discovery of oil iin the mid 1800s also provided the first source of fuel for these new vehicles. The first commercial ooil well was drilled in 1859(a mere 130-140 years ago) by Edwin Drake in Pennsylvania, USA.&nbsp;<br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Steam engines became weeded out at the end of the 1800s because the combustion engine made it more efficient to burn oil. Prior this change in production and transportation, the oil industry was concerned with lubricants, lighting and kerosene, and niches like cosmetics and medicine-demand for oil was small compared to what the demand was when new accessible technologies became available after the combustion engine was invented.</span><br><br><br><br><br></p>

In contrast the bicycle was not initially developed for that purpose and was seen as a novelty or racing vehicle that could transport individuals a bit faster than walking in the time of its conception.

                    <p style="width: 677.67px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rachel Carson's work may bear similarities to a relationship we see between humanity and the automobile. For example when DDT</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;was developed , people all over the world were drenching themselves in this unknowingly toxic substance to repel insects and it lead to significant health defects in its users. Prior to her study, the substance was readily used. There was alot more to it than the end use of the product- and up until today, this is still a difficult concept for our culture to adopt since our&nbsp; culture prioritizes certain definitions of efficiency, and economics.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">other examples of products which have gained prevalence in our normalized culture but have recently been found to have unethical roots and ideological discrepancies include</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">-Fast and processed foods- originally a convenient tasty alternative to cooking- now recognized to be a significant contributor to many chronic illnesses with unethical roots in its production and the manner in which marketing enabled fast food to enter into our culture through generations</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">-Smoking- Originally a Native American traditional ceremonial practice, brought back/stolen by Europeans, then used marketed in modern times until almost everyone was smoking at one point- until it was realized that smoking was also a significant cause of serious chronic illnesses and that marketers were exploiting peoples addiction</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">-Plastic-originally branded as a material that would "save" elephants from being hunted for their tusks, a cheap and accessible material, then marketed in the 1980s as a feasible alternative to cleaning and washing dishes- Has now become realized for the incredible amount of toxic garbage and environmental ecological impact it has produced</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These examples all have similarities that we encourage intelligent persons to evaluate for themselves. Many of the deep fundamental ideologies that act as the premise that governments accept which permit harmful products and substances to persist come from a primitive time in our civilization. We may think we are very modern however some of the implications of&nbsp; seemingly regular social behaviours and cultures are very seriously beside the most primitive forms of slavery racism inequality exploitation and violence.&nbsp; Importantly we want to emphasize how much real benefit bicycles have been found to generate , and how harmless they have consistently been through hundreds of years now.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Disposable plastic socia l media that banks on shock- and&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These are all examples of things that were developed under an ideological premise that ultimately prioritizes profit in the immediate term.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And we may engage with such products readily as they become normal and popular even though we may have very serious fundamental disagreements with using such products in principle and in the long term they contribute to extremely immoral sentiments, especially felt by the natural world.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">things may even become so normal that we forget to think, that we develop trust in sources we dont know, that we become lazy and fall for the idea that our own individual thoughts and actions will make no difference in the world.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We think its important to understand that our culture comes from a place that may not necessarily be moral or consistent with our individual personal values.&nbsp; We just want to promote critical thinking when it comes to evaluating products we engage with indirectly because our current culture pushes us to NOT THINK at all, especially when it comes to consumer products. Advertisers dont want us to think about anything other than what they want to show us, and yet what they show us is all we generally will see. From this perspective you can be sure , and we can attest based on empirical studies that the bicycle is not doing much harm in the world. The bicycle is a good choice. when it comes to considering motorized derivatives of bicycles we ask the reader to think more critically about what they are promoting in terms of what advancement will constitute, when it comes to bicycles.&nbsp; More of which will be elaborated in the second part of this article series.</span><br></p>

If oil reserves werent discovered maybe we would still have a mechanical and steam world. Imagine how it would look if history took place in a different way. What kind of world would it have been if&nbsp; humanity developed the combustion engine a few hundred years after the bicycle?&nbsp; maybe even our commercial production technology would be powered by human pedalling.

The invention of the first bicycle, credited to Karl von Drais in 1817, marked a significant milestone. However, it wasn't until the late 19th century, with the introduction of the safety bicycle, that bicycles became an efficient form of personal transportation. Compared to walking or running, bicycles offer a significant increase in efficiency, allowing riders to travel longer distances with less energy expenditure.</span><br></p>

                    <p>blurb<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">EFFICIENCYBicycles are remarkably efficient machines. up to 99% of mechanical energy is transmitted to the wheels. According to empirical studies, cycling is calculated to be the most efficient self-powered means of transportation, requiring significantly less energy expenditure compared to walking and running. For instance, a human traveling on a bicycle at 16-24 km/h uses only the power required to walk, making cycling about three times more efficient than walking the same distance.¹ and for many who do not travel for long distances regularly, the bicycle is only about 5 or 10 minutes behind a vehicle. In high density urban areas like Toronto&nbsp; it may even be faster to cycle due to traffic.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Stigmas and Forgotten PotentialThe potential benefits of prioritizing bicycles in transportation planning are substantial. Not only can it improve physical health, but it can also reduce air pollution, decrease traffic congestion, and increase mobility. To those who say we can't change the way we've planned our cities, I'd argue that it's precisely the rigid adherence to car-centric planning that's limiting our potential. By prioritizing bicycles, we can reclaim our streets, improve our health, and create more sustainable communities. We are versatile and creative, there isnt just one way of doing things, and yet humans have the primitive instinct to follow , regardless if ultimately these activities or behaviours are dysfunctional or we disagree with their underlying meaning.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now lets review the time period we just talked about</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And lets consider when the automobile was invented</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 229, 153);">bicycles outperform other modes of transportation in terms of energy efficiency. in the Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports researchers found that cyclists exercising on a cycle ergometer at 90 rpm and 200 W using different pedaling techniques showed varying levels of mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency. The results highlighted the importance of optimizing pedaling technique to maximize efficiency.²</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 229, 153);">Efficiency within bicycles can depend on 3 things</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 229, 153);">1. Bike fit: Proper bike fit can significantly impact pedaling efficiency.2. Rider technique: Efficient pedaling techniques, such as using the correct muscle groups, can improve pedaling efficiency.3. Bike design: Aerodynamic bike design, gearing, and component quality can also affect pedaling efficiency.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 229, 153);">Riding a fixie bike will give you some perspective on the beauty of gear shifting bicycles with derailleurs. It is truly magical in the most subjective sense. An affordable personal vehicle that operates on a persons own energy and steering. Exhilarating.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
