                <p class="text-center">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a rider you would know that what you see can become alot like art. as the senses respond to stimulus moving at observable pace in a relatively short amount of time. relative to a car, you are generally closer to objects, and have enough time to envision them closely as you pass them by. The sky, the art on the walls, the architecture, the people all seem to come alive in front of you, removed from moving encapsulations. It might be arguable that maybe it wouldnt be that way if automobiles were smaller or without enclosures perhaps... The enclosure is something interesting to think about when we think about what captured the senses&nbsp; of our populations... extra protection storage and privacy. and in exchange our appearance maybe becomes exchanged for the vehicle one is riding.<br><br>&nbsp; Despite being an innovative and liberating technology, the bicycle has often been overlooked as a subject in major creative works. Throughout history, its impact on the senses and the freedom it brings to riders have been underappreciated. Unlike enclosed vehicles, cycling offers a unique perspective and experience, allowing riders to connect with their surroundings in a way that's both exhilarating and inspiring. Unfortunately, bicycles are often overshadowed by cars and misconstrued as a mode of transportation for those with limited means. Our goal is to challenge this perception and inspire artists, creators, and riders to celebrate the bicycle's beauty, functionality, and the ideas it sparks. By highlighting the bicycle's significance and showcasing its place in art and culture, we hope to rekindle appreciation for this remarkable invention and the joy it brings to those who ride.<br><br>https://www.tiktok.com/@dig_ex_/video/7345205918101048622?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7491313610368763398<br></p>

                <h1><span style="font-style: normal !important; background-color: transparent;">Saul Steinberg's Illustrations</span><br></h1>
                <p>Saul Steinberg incorporated bicycles into his artwork as part of his broader commentary on modern life, using them in famous illustrations like the one featuring a cat riding a bicycle over a bridge in "March to April" (1966). Bicycles also appear in his work as individual motifs, sometimes in series like the Drawn Blank series, reflecting his definition of drawing as a way of reasoning on paper. Steinberg even had his own bicycle and was photographed with it, though the extent of his personal connection to cycling is not detailed.&nbsp;<br><br>Artistic Representations of Bicycles<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"March to April" (1966):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This color illustration is a notable example of Steinberg using a bicycle to create a whimsical scene.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Drawn Blank Series:<br><br>The series includes works like the large gouache sketch "Bicycle," where the motif is explored in different artistic contexts.&nbsp;<br>Motif in his Work:<br><br>Bicycles serve as recurring symbols in his drawings, which often explore the semantics of art and modern life.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Steinberg's Connection to Bicycles<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bicycles as a Tool for Reasoning:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Steinberg viewed drawing as a way to "reason on paper," and bicycles are one of the elements he used in this process, alongside other forms like umbrellas.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Personal Photographs:<br><br>Images of Steinberg with his bicycle exist, placing him personally within the world he depicted in his art.&nbsp;<br><br><br>In essence, bicycles were an element within Steinberg's expansive artistic vocabulary, allowing him to comment on themes of modernity and the human experience through his unique style.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p>images:<br>https://twistedsifter.com/2013/10/ai-weiwei-forever-bicycles-installation-toronto/<br><br>Ai Weiwei's bicycle installations, primarily the series known as Forever Bicycles, are large-scale sculptures made from thousands of interconnected bicycle frames. The installations use the common Chinese bicycle brand, Forever, to symbolize transportation, freedom, and the changing social landscape in China and globally. These monumental works are often displayed in public spaces, creating visually complex, labyrinth-like structures.&nbsp;<br><br>Key Aspects<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sculptures are composed of identical bicycle frames from the "Forever" brand, a popular and accessible bicycle in China during Ai Weiwei's youth.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Symbolism:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom and Mobility: Bicycles represent freedom of movement and the ability for individuals to navigate their world, reflecting both the past limitations and evolving freedoms in China.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Social Change: The immense scale and optical illusions of the interconnected bicycles create a mesmerizing, evolving visual space that symbolizes the dynamic and often overwhelming changes in China's social environment.&nbsp;<br>Commemoration: The "Forever" brand also serves as a tribute to this era and the role bicycles played in China's history, a time when they were financially out of reach for many.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Installation:<br><br>The large sculptures are constructed in modules and assembled on-site, creating structures that can be 300 feet long and 30 feet wide.&nbsp;<br>Purpose:<br><br>Ai Weiwei is known for his activism and for challenging authoritarianism through his art, and these bicycle installations often serve as a way to provoke thought and conversation about freedom and societal transformation.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Notable Works<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever Bicycles (Taipei, 2011):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first version of the work, which appeared in 2011.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Forever Bicycles (Toronto, 2013):<br><br>A 3,144-bicycle installation at Nathan Phillips Square for the Nuit Blanche art festival.&nbsp;<br>Forever Bicycles (Winnipeg, 2019):<br><br>A version featuring 1,254 bicycles was loaned to The Forks for three years, a donation from businessman Michael Nesbitt.&nbsp;<br>Forever Bicycles (Winnipeg, 2024):<br><br>A new loan brought the installation back to Winnipeg, where it was reassembled overlooking the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h1><span style="font-style: normal !important; background-color: transparent;">Eduardo Paolozzi's Art</span><br></h1>
                <p>IMAGES:<br>https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/345<br><br><br>Eduardo Paolozzi, a pioneer of Pop Art, frequently incorporated bicycle parts and industrial machine elements into his art, which he explored through various media<br><br>. Instead of simply painting or sculpting a bicycle, he used its components to deconstruct and reassemble his artwork, reflecting his fascination with the intersection of technology and mass culture.<br><br>Examples of Paolozzi's bicycle art<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;His Majesty the Wheel (1957): This assemblage sculpture features modular machine and bicycle components pressed into clay and then cast in bronze using the lost wax technique. The surface of the work is scarred with the impressions of cogs, nuts, and chains, with the final result appearing less as a human figure and more as a construction of mechanical parts.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyclops (1957): This bronze sculpture, held in the Tate collection, showcases Paolozzi's technique of using impressions of gears, wheels, and machines to create scarred and textured surfaces on his figures.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Textile designs (1950s): During his time teaching textile design at the Central School of Art and Design, Paolozzi created colorful, playful fabric patterns. These dizzying, repeated prints incorporated everyday objects like bicycle wheels, baked beans, and squiggles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bunk!" collages (1947–1952): In this series of influential pop art collages, Paolozzi used found images from American magazines, including visuals of technology and machines. While not exclusively focused on bicycles, this work showcases his use of vernacular culture, which inspired his machine-like bronze works.&nbsp;<br><br><br>The process behind the art<br><br>In the 1950s, Paolozzi developed a unique process for his bronze sculptures. He would:&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Press found objects, such as bicycle chains, cogs, and machine parts, into slabs of clay.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour wax into the imprints left in the clay.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut, tear, and reassemble the wax sheets into new, fragile assemblages.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast the final assembly in bronze, with the impressions of the objects now textured onto the metal surface.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <h1>Photography from the "BIcycle Craze"</h1>
                <p>Photography from the bicycle craze period (primarily the 1890s) captured the social and technological changes brought by the popularity of the "safety bicycle," including images of women cyclists embracing new freedoms and fashion (like bloomers), mens' cycling clubs, outdoor races, and the use of bicycles for recreation and transportation. The era saw the simultaneous rise of the "hand camera" making photography more accessible, leading to more amateur photographers documenting the craze.&nbsp;<br>Key Themes and Subjects in Photography:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's Emancipation:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Photos often show women riding, sometimes without chaperones, demonstrating their new independence and challenging traditional roles.&nbsp;<br><br>Fashion and Dress Reform:<br><br>Images feature women in practical cycling attire, such as bloomers and shorter skirts, which were a significant departure from Victorian fashion.&nbsp;<br>Cycling Culture and Clubs:<br><br>Photographs document the organized aspect of the craze, including bicycle club outings, races, and meetings in urban and rural settings.&nbsp;<br>New Technology and Infrastructure:<br><br>The safety bicycle, which replaced the high-wheeled "penny-farthing," was central to these images, as were photos of bicycles on new road networks and at races on banked velodromes.&nbsp;<br>Outdoor Recreation:<br><br>Cyclists were often photographed in picturesque natural settings, reflecting the bicycle's role in the growing outdoor recreation movement.&nbsp;<br>Everyday Life and Urban Scenes:<br><br>Pictures captured the general public using bicycles for transportation and daily activities, such as cyclists navigating city streets.&nbsp;<br><br>The Photography Itself:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hand Camera's Role:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The popularization of the Kodak and other hand cameras in the 1890s made photography easier and more widely accessible, contributing to the visual record of the bicycle craze.&nbsp;<br><br>Diverse Settings:<br><br>Images range from formal composite photographs of cycling clubs to casual snapshots of individuals and groups on country roads and city streets.&nbsp;<br>Symbolism:<br><br>Photographs were used to promote the ideals of the bicycle craze, showcasing freedom, health, and the "poetry of motion".&nbsp;<br></p>
