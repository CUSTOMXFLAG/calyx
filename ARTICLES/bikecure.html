The guards began to exhibit sadistic tendencies, enforcing arbitrary rules and punishing prisoners, while the prisoners became submissive and depressed.<br>- The Findings: The Stanford Prison Experiment revealed the power of situational factors in shaping behavior, particularly when it comes to roles of authority and power. The study showed how quickly normal, well-adjusted individuals can become perpetrators of abuse when given power and placed in certain situations.<br><br>Regarding power posing, research by Amy Cuddy and others has shown that adopting expansive, open body language (power posing) can:<br>- Increase feelings of power: Power posing can increase testosterone levels and decrease cortisol levels, leading to feelings of confidence and power.<br>- Influence behavior: Power posing has been linked to changes in behavior, such as increased risk-taking and more assertive behavior.<br><br>In the context of the Stanford Prison Experiment, it's interesting to consider how power posing might have influenced the behavior of the guards and prisoners. For example:<br>- Guards' power posing: The guards' adoption of authoritarian postures and behaviors might have been reinforced by their power posing, contributing to their sadistic tendencies.<br>- Prisoners' submissive postures: Conversely, the prisoners' submissive postures and behaviors might have been exacerbated by their lack of power posing, contributing to their feelings of powerlessness and depression.<br><br>While the relationship between power posing and the Stanford Prison Experiment is speculative, it's clear that body language and posture can play a significant role in shaping our behavior and interactions with others.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEB6RQE8wp4<br><br><br>Power Posing:<br><br><br>study that found after 20 minute walk what it did for the brain<br><br>a word for older and aging people<br><br>a word for younger people<br><br><br><br>a word about injury risk and a comparison between vehicular accidents and cycling accidents<br><br>studies that go under the radar<br><br><br>alot of car riders find themselves inside of an empty bull<br><br>alot of car riders are redundant thinkers<br><br>people that like uniformity, they want to fit in with all the other grey shirts, they want to follow the trends, they want to make the safe bet--- and they pay for it- alot<br><br>and what youlll see for a sad population of the elderly that need care-- a very populos amount of peple who actually "founded" the land we walk on- that treaded the same workplaces in the same fashion, to contribute to an economy and attain perosnal belongings, dont get ENOUGH care- and they get isolated socially. stranded.<br><br><br>if you look at a baby and show them mmississauga and say thats the world i think thats a crime. you can walk at the street of "downtown" to get a sense of exactly what i mean. a sad parade of immigrant muppets in a poorly planned landscape comfortable because its&nbsp; safe relative to the place of their origin and stimulate the sup par, second rate culture. its a place where a simple man with a mind exposed to very simple ideas really thought his car was "nice". its a place where the children try very hard to talk like drake even though their not from where that is</p>

                <p style="width: 941.33px;">the second one is:<br>Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Here's a brief summary:<br>- The Study: Participants were recruited to take part in a study on learning and punishment. They were assigned the role of "teacher" and were told to administer electric shocks to a "learner" (an actor) every time the learner answered a question incorrectly.<br>- The Twist: The teacher and learner were separated by a wall, and the teacher could hear the learner's responses but not see them. The experimenter (a doctor or authority figure) instructed the teacher to increase the intensity of the shocks with each incorrect answer.<br>- The Results: Surprisingly, many participants were willing to administer extremely painful and even supposedly lethal shocks to the learner, simply because the experimenter told them to do so. This revealed the power of obedience to authority and the extent to which individuals might go against their own moral values when directed by someone in a position of authority.<br><br>The Milgram Experiment has been widely studied and debated, and its findings have implications for our understanding of human behavior, particularly in situations where individuals are faced with conflicting moral and authority-driven demands.<br><br>Is there something specific you'd like to know or discuss about the Milgram Experiment?<br></p>
